# Some-Machine-Learning-Codes
## This repository contains Machine Learning codes that are part of the projects developed during the online course MITx 6.86x: Machine Learning with Python: From linear models to Deep Learning, which I took from Sep to Dec 2020. In particular it contains the following:
## * A Convolutional Neural Network model for recognition of hand-written digits that partially overlap.
## * A clustering model based on Gaussian mixtures for Netflix film rating prediction.
